To recreate this app locally (WIP):

Download and install VSCode

- https://code.visualstudio.com/

Install npm

- https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

Install yarn

- https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

Install nvm

- windows: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
- linux / mac: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

Follow nvm directions to install and use node v18.20.4

Once installation and setup is complete:

1. clone this repo locally
2. open local repo folder in vscode
3. install packages (type "yarn" in console, there should be a 'node_modules' folder in the directory now).
4. run dev environment: type "yarn dev" in console (no quotations)

Because this uses some out-of-date libraries there may be issues with installation. Feel free to email michael.sweeney@pnnl.gov for help
