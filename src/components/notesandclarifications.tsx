          This calculator is based on interpretation of NYC Local Law 97 – 2019
          and provides only an approximation of the impact of the carbon
          emissions limits. As actual results will vary the tool should not be
          relied on as specific legal or risk mitigation guidance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Emission limits for the years 2035 thru 2050 are not yet determined
          for each individual occupancy group. The tool estimates a penalty for
          those years based on the average value for all covered buildings
          identified in the law.
        </li>
        <li>
          City agency rulemaking and enforcement practices may significantly
          impact the application of LL97 to individual buildings.
        </li>

        <li>
          LL97 provides a number of possible adjustments to the annual building
          emissions limit, including appeal based on special circumstances and
          critical building uses. These are not accounted for in the calculator.
